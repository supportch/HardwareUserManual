# 8.1	Using built-in ‘fsck’ to fix disk

fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file systems. The file system can be a device name \(e.g. /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2\), a mount point \(e.g. /usr/home\). If the M.2 2230 SATA is booted to terminal, then type the following command.

$fsck /dev/sdxxx

The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:

 0 - No errors

 1 - File system errors corrected

 2 - System should be rebooted

 4 - File system errors left uncorrected

 8 - Operational error

 16 - Usage or syntax error

 32 - Fsck canceled by user request

 128 - Shared library error

If file system errors not corrected then re-flash the image in M.2 2230 SATA which is provided as backup in DVD. To re-flash refer step 3 in [Appendix G.](../9-appendices/appendix-g-dd-command-for-image-backup.md)
