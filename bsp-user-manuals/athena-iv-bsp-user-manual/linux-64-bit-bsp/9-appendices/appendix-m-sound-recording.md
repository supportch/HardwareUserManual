# Appendix L: Sound recording

The GUI base sound recorder utility is broken in Ubuntu-20.04.1 OS, so the Ubuntu community suggested to use command line application to record sound from MIC In or Line In port.

Prior to recording the sound user has to select the sound input from Line In or MIC input port.

To select Mic In input port, select Microphone option as shown in following picture

To record the sound from selected input port, run the following command in terminal, to stop recording press Ctrl+C. The recorded file will be stored in current directory.
