# Layer 2 - Webstax

The WebStaX \(VSC6812SDK\) software development kit is a turnkey, fully managed L2 switch application designed to support all managed enterprise switches, including devices that support stacking \(hardware stacking integrated in a chip\). WebStaX includes the full source code, compiler, and tools. The SDK is customizable to support various port configurations, with or without stacking. The SDS delivers a superior stacking solution, with support for up to 16 units in a single stack, single point of management, and shortest path forwarding. All slave units are backup masters. Worst-case master re-elect across the stack is less than 10 ms for stackable enterprise switches. WebStaX uses the latest eCos operating system for optimal performance and cost effective implementation, and RedBoot bootloader for reliability. Management is performed through a Web GUI, Command Line Interface \(CLI\), Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\), or Java Script Object Notation Remote Procedure Call \(JSON-RPC\), running on the internal MIPS24Kec CPU. WebStaX is highly integrated with switch features such as QCLs, ACLs, HW MACtable synchronization across the stack, and super priority management queue.
