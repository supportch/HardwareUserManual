# Layer 3 - IstaX

The IStaX \(VSC6817SDK\) Linux Application Software Package is a turnkey Industrial Ethernet switch solution designed to support Microsemi's managed Ethernet switch devices. The software uses the latest Linux operating system for optimal performance and cost effective implementation. Management is performed using a Web GUI, Command Line Interface \(CLI\), Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\), or Java Script Object Notation Remote Procedure Call \(JSON RPC\), running on the internal MIPS24Kec CPU. The VSC6817SDK is highly integrated with advanced L2 switch features such as QCLs and ACLs, and includes support for synchronization functions such as Synchronous Ethernet, IEEE 1588, and third-party servos, and protection functions including linear and ring protection.

**Key Features**

* Advanced L2 switching and L3 forwarding including VLANs, GVRP, IGMP, flow mirroring, and DHCP option 82
* SyncE and IEEE 1588 solution with PTP protocol, and hardware-accurate time stamping. For high accuracy applications, a Microsemi DPLL and separately-licensed servo algorithm are required.
* G.8031 link protection and G.8032 ring protection
