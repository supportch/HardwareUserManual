# 13.1. Heat Sink

The heat sink, ~~DSC part no. 6883111~~, ~~is 16.6mm~~ high and is the same size as the module, ~~55x84mm~~. It is mounted on the top of the board using the four corner mounting holes. The heat sink holes are clear to facilitate the use of ~~M2.5~~ screws inserting through the heat sink and catching in the threaded spacers installed below the module. Height is measured from the top of the EPSM-10GX4 PCB. A STEP file and mechanical drawing are available. An image of the heat sink mounted on the EPSM-10GX4 is shown below.
