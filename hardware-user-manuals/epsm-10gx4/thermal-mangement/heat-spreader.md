# 13.2. Heat Spreader

The heat spreader, ~~DSC part no. 6883114~~, provides a flat surface for installation onto the interior surface of the system enclosure. A thermal pad embedded in the top of the heat spreader provides improved contact for reduced thermal resistance between the heat spreader and the enclosure surface. The thermal pad contains a protective film which must be removed prior to installation. Flanges on the heat spreader enable installation of the module from either the interior or the exterior of the enclosure. Overall dimensions of the heat spreader are ~~55mm H x 104mm W x 7.6mm H~~. Height is measured from the top of the EPSM-10GX4 PCB. A STEP file and mechanical drawing are available. An image of the heat spreader installed on the EPS-120000-CMH product is shown below.
