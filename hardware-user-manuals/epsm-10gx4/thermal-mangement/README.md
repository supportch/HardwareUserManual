# 13. Thermal Management

Two cooling options, a heat sink and a heat spreader, are available for the EPSM-10GX4 to facilitate installation of the module in the end equipment. Both options offer full 85oC performance under proper conditions, however the heat spreader is generally the prefer option since it conducts the heat to the system chassis instead of to the internal air of the system. The heat sink and heat spreader are accessory items and must be ordered separately.
