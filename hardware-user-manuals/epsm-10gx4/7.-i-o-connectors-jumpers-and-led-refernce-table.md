# 8. JUMPER CONFIGURATION

## 8.1 Serial Port & DIO Pu-PD Configuration \[JP1\]

The 2x6 2mm jumper JP1 is used to:

### 8.1.1 Select the protocol for the serial ports

The serial port protocol mode selection is as tabulated below:

![JP1 configurations for serial ports protocol selection](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28230%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the serial ports' outputs are disabled to prevent any accidental damages to the port pair.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The protocol selection remains same for serial ports 1 & 2 and serial ports 3 &4 ie inserting a jumper on location 5 on JP1 configures the both serial ports 1 & 2 in RS-232 mode
{% endhint %}

### 8.1.2 Enable the pull-up or pull-down on the DIOs

The on-boards DIOs can be pulled up or down with the help of jumper JP1.The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP1 configured to enable \(a\) Pull-down \(b\) Pull-up on the DIOs](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28253%29.png)

## 8.2 LVDS Scan & Mapping \[JP4\]

The 2x2 2mm jumper JP4 is used to set the scan direction & mapping for certain LVDS displays. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![LVDS display configured for \(a\) Normal scan &amp; map A \(b\) Reverse scan &amp; map B](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28251%29.png)

## 8.3 LVDS LCD Panel Voltage Select \[JP5\]

The 1x7 2.54mm jumper JP5 is used to configure the LVDS LCD panel voltages. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP5 configurations for LVDS LCD VDD &amp; backlight inverter VDD](../../.gitbook/assets/jp5_lvds_bklt.png)

![JP5 configurations for \(a\) LCD VDD = 3.3V, Backlight inverter VDD = 5V \(b\) = LCD VDD = 5V, Backlight inverter VDD = 12V](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28241%29.png)

## 8.4 ISA IRQ \[JP6\]

The 2x9 2mm jumper JP6 is used to configure the IRQ for the COM & ADC IRQ. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![IRQ settings for COM3, COM4 &amp; A/D](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28222%29.png)

![IRQ configurations for COM3, COM4 &amp; A/D](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28232%29.png)

## 8.5 Termination Enable for Serial Ports \[JP7, JP8\]

The two 2x5 2mm jumpers JP7 & JP8 are used to enable the 121E termination for the serial ports in RS-422 & RS-485 protocol modes. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![Termination enable configuration for RS-422 &amp; RS-485 protocol modes](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28226%29.png)

![Termination jumper configurations for \(a\) RS-232 \(b\) RS-422 or RS-485](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28247%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
In RS-232, make sure to remove all the jumpers as the serial ports might end up failing due to the 121E termination on the communication lines
{% endhint %}

## 8.6 SPI Select \[JP9\]

The 2x3 2mm jumper JP9 is used to configure the SPI lines to the FPGA SPI flash & enable the board power in absence of CoM. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP9 configurations for SPI select &amp; board power enable](../../.gitbook/assets/jp9_spi-sel.png)

![JP9 configurations for \(a\) CS\# control \(b\) SPI &amp; CS\# control \(c\) Board power enable](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28227%29.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Jumper on JP9 location 4 should never be mounted in presence of CoM. Mounting like this may damage the CoM
{% endhint %}
