# 8. CONNECTOR PINOUTS

## 8.1 Input Power Connector

The system provides a barrel connector for main input power. The connector has a 2.5mm center pin and is intended for use with mating connectors with 2.5mm inner diameter and 5.5mm outer diameter. Input voltage = +7V to +24V.

The connections for the power input connector are Tip = +V and Ring = -V.

## **8.14** J19: PCIe M.2 SSD Socket \(M-Key, 2280 Size\)

The Floyd carrier board is equipped with an M.2 PCIe SSD M-keyed connector for 2280 sized modules for storage applications.

The PCIe link routing from the Jetson module to the M.2 socket varies according to the Jetbox-Floyd model.

 **JB-FLD-NAO/XNX-01:** The PCIe x4 link from the Jetson module is routed to a switch which provies 3 PCIe x1 links for the M.2 socket, PCIe minicard socket, and 2nd Ethernet port.

 **JB-FLD-NAO/XNX-02**The x4 PCIe link is directly connected to the M.2 socket for maximum bandwidth. The minicard and 2nd Ethernet port are not present. With the Jetson Xavier NX module installed, an additional PCIe x1 lane interface can be mapped from the NX to the second Ethernet.
