Jetbox-Floyd assembly is basically split into two parts:

1. Installing the Jetson Module on Floyd
2. Installing Floyd inside the Jetbox

## 13.1 Installing the Jetson Module on Floyd

1. If not present on board, install 2 M2.5 x 6.5mm long spacers along board edge. See illustration below

2. Insert module into socket at 45 degree angle. See illustration.

  3. Push down module so that both side latches click fully into position. The module PCB may have to be pushed down and module "clicks" into the connector.
