# 7. JUMPER CONFIGURATION

{% hint style="info" %}
To access the jumpers on the Floyd baseboard, the TOP heat spreader plate needs to be removed from the Jetbox-Floyd. 
{% endhint %}

The various jumpers for the Jetbox-Floyd provided by the Floyd baseboard are as provided below:

1. JP1: DIO Pull/UP Down Enable/Disable
2. JP2: Protocol Mode Select & Termination Enable 
3. JP3: USB 2.0 - 1 Mode Select

## 7.1 JP1: DIO Pull/UP Down Enable/Disable

  
The Jumper blocks on the Floyd carrier board can be configured to enable/disable pull up/pull down settings on the GPIOs using Jumper shunts.

The Digital I/Os on the board can be configured to pull-up to 3.3V or pull-down to GND through Jumper Block JP1.

The jumper configurations are specified in the following table and illustrated below:

| Jumper Position | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| PU | Enable pull-up on the DI/Os |
| **PD\*** | **Enable pull-down on the DI/Os** |
| \* Default Mode |  |

## 7.2 JP2: Protocol Mode Select & Termination Enable

The Jumper Block JP2 provides the options to select RS232, RS422, and RS485 protocols on the serial ports. 

By default, jumper position 1 in the RS232 in full-duplex mode is selected.

| Position 1 | Position 2 | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In\*** | **Out\*** | **Serial Ports 1-2 RS-232 Mode**  |
| Out | In | Serial Ports 1-2 RS-485 Mode |
| Out | Out | Serial Ports 1-2 RS-422 Mode |
| \*: Default |  |  |

The JP1 jumper configurations across the different product variations are as shown below:

## 7.3 JP3: USB2.0 - 1 Mode Select

The USB2.0 Port 1 on the carrier board can be configured to function as a Host or a Device by selecting the Jumper positions on Jumper Block JP3. 

When configured as a **HOST** port, the USB port functions in the normal mode. When configured as a **DEVICE**, the USB port functions as an OTG \(On-The-Go\) device that implements RECOVERY mode to enable flashing the Jetson module\(s\). 

By default, the USB2.0 Port 1 port is configured as Host. The jumper configurations are specified in the following table and illustrated below:

| Jumper Block | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| D | USB2.0 Port 1  Port as DEVICE  for Recovery Mode |
| **H\*** | **USB2.0 Port 1  Port as HOST in Normal Mode** |
| \* Default Mode |  |
