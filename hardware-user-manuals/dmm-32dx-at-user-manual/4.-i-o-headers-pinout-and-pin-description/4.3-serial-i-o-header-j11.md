# 4.3 Serial I/O Header â€“ J11

Diamond-MM-32DX-AT provides a 7-pin right-angle friction-lock header on the left edge of the board labeled J11 for an auxiliary power connection. The power pins may be used to provide power to the board in standalone operation \(not used in a PC/104 stack\). When the board is installed in a PC/104 stack, the +5V pin may be used as a source of +5V for auxiliary devices \(maximum current 1 Amp\) but should NOT be used for power input.
