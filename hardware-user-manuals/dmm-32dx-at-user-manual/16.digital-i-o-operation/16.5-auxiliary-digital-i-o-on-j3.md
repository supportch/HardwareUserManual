# 16.5 Auxiliary Digital I/O on J3

J3 contains 3 digital outputs and 4 digital inputs that can be used for general purpose digital I/O or for A/D and counter/timer functions. The operation of these bits is controlled with various bits in two control registers.

#### Outputs

#### Ctr 2 Out / Dout 2       J3 pin 42

The function of this pin is determined by OUT2EN, Base + 10 bit 5:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Counter 2 output is routed to this pin |
| 0 | This pin is controlled by bit DOUT2 at Base + 1 bit 2 |

#### Dout 1         J3 pin 43

This pin is always the value written to DOUT1 at Base + 1 bit 1.

**Ctr 0 Out / Dout 0      J3 pin 44**

The function of this pin is determined by OUT0EN, Base + 10 bit 4:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Counter 0 output is routed to this pin |
| 0 | This pin is controlled by bit DOUT0 at Base + 1 bit 0 |

**Inputs**

#### Extclk / Din3       J3 pin 45 

This signal may always be read at Base + 4 bit 3. It may function as an external clock to control A/D conversion timing when CLKEN = 1 and CLKSEL = 0 in Base + 9. 

#### Extgate / Din2      ****J3 pin 46 

This signal may always be read at Base + 4 bit 2. It may function as an external gate to enable and disable A/D conversions when GT12EN = 1 in Base + 10 bit 0. 

#### Gate 0 / Din1       J3 pin 47 

This signal may always be read at Base + 4 bit 1. It may function as an external gate for Counter 0 when GT0EN = 1 in Base + 10 bit 2. When used as a gate it is active high, meaning that Counter 0 will count as long as it is high and will not count when it is low. 

#### Clk 0 / Din0       J3 pin 48 

This signal may always be read at Base + 4 bit 0. It may function as an external clock for counter 0 when SRC0 = 0 in Base + 10 bit 1. When used as a clock for Counter 0, the rising edge is active.
