# 5.2 Interrupt level

Interrupts are used for hardware I/O operations that are independent of normal program flow. Diamond-MM-32DX-AT can be set up to generate interrupts under several circumstances. The most common use of interrupts is to transfer A/D data from the board to system memory during high-speed A/D sampling. The board can also generate interrupts to transfer digital data into or out of the board, as well as at regular intervals according to a programmable timer on the board. Individual control bits are used to enable each type of interrupt. Jumper block J7 contains pins for selecting the interrupt level. To set the desired level, install a jumper under that levelâ€™s IRQ number and also in the R position. The R position connects a 1K-ohm pull-down resistor to the selected IRQ line to allow the board to share the IRQ level with another board in the system. Note that only one pulldown resistor should be installed on any IRQ level. If you have another board in the system using the same IRQ level as Diamond-MM-32DX-AT, and that board has the pulldown resistor already configured, then remove the jumper from the R position on J7.
