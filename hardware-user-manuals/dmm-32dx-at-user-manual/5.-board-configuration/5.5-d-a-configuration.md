# 5.5 D/A Configuration

The four analog outputs on DMM-32DX-AT can be set individually or all at once to operate in bipolar \(both + and â€“\) or unipolar \(+ only\) output voltage ranges with the full-scale output range set to 5V, 10V, or programmable. The maximum output current on any channel is 5mA. Current outputs such as 0-20mA outputs are not supported. Moreover, the hardware jumper settings can be overridden by software by setting the bit D/A JPOVRD when the board is operating in maximum mode. 

On power-up, the DACs are configured to reset to mid-scale \(0V in bipolar mode\) or zero scale \(0V in unipolar mode\) so that the DACs power up to 0V. 

In programmable mode, the full-scale output voltage can be set anywhere from 0V to 10V in software. You must use the Universal Driver software to set programmable D/A range, as it requires calibration to fine-tune the setting to the desired value. The Diamond-MM-32DX-AT demo package includes a section showing how to set the D/A range in software. 

To configure the analog output range, set jumper block J6 according to the tables below. The first two positions are used for the output range, the third position is to determine the output polarity and the fourth position is to determine a fixed or variable full-scale output. The use of the 5th position can be defined by the user for uses that do or do not involve the D/A converter. 

Placing the jumper in position grounds the corresponding control signal. For example, inserting the B/\(U\) jumper sets the board to unipolar mode.
