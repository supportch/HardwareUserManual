# 5.1 Base Address

Each board in a PC/104 system must have its own unique block of addresses that does not overlap with any other board in the system or feature on the CPU. The lowest address of this address block is called the base address. Diamond-MM-32DX-AT's base address is set with 3 pairs of pins marked “ADDR” on pin header J7, located near the PC/104 bus connectors. The table below lists the 8 possible jumper configurations and the corresponding base addresses.
