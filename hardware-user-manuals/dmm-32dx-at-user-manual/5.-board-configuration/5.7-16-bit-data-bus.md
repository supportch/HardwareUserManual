# 5.7 16-Bit Data Bus

The board can be configured for 16-bit read operations when reading the A/D data. To do this, install a jumper in the “16” location on J7. A 16-bit transfer will only occur during a 16-bit read instruction from the base address \(A/D data\) when a jumper is in the “16” position and the board is in a 16-bit bus \(both PC/104 J1 and J2 connectors are connected to the CPU\). Otherwise the A/D board and host CPU will ignore the 16-bit setting and/or instruction and convert the 16-bit operation into two 8-bit read operations from Base + 0 and Base + 1.
