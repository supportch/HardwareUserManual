# 8.3 A/D Conversion Formulas

The 16-bit value returned by the A/D converter is always a twos complement number ranging from -32768 to 32767, regardless of the input range. This is because the input range of the A/D is fixed at 10V. The input signal is actually magnified and shifted to match this range before it reaches the A/D. For example, for an input range of 0-10V, the signal is first shifted down by 5V to 5V and then amplified by 2 to become 10V. Therefore, two different formulas are needed to convert the A/D value back to a voltage, one for bipolar ranges, and one for unipolar ranges. 

Tables showing the correlation between A/D code and input voltage are shown on the following page.

### **For Bipolar Input Ranges**

FS = full-scale voltage \(e.g. 5V for 5V range\) 

#### If using a 16-bit signed integer in C: Input voltage = \(A/D code / 32768\) x FS 

**Example:**     5V range selected, A/D code = 17762 \(Hex 4560\) Input voltage = \(17762 / 32768\) x 5V = +2.7103V 

**Example:**     5V range selected, A/D code = -15008 \(Hex C560\) Input voltage = \(-15008 / 32768\) x 5V = -2.2900V 

If using a 32-bit signed integer in C, or unsigned or floating value in C or Basic: 

Input voltage = \(A/D code / 32768\) x FS 

If input voltage &gt;= FS then input voltage = input voltage - 2 x FS 

**Example:**     5V range selected, A/D code = 17762 \(Hex 4560\) Input voltage = \(17762 / 32768\) x 5V = +2.7103V 

**Example:**     5V range selected, A/D code = 50528 \(Hex C560\) 

Input voltage = \(50528 / 32768\) x 5V = +7.7100V 

Since 7.7100V &gt;= 5V, we must subtract: 

Input voltage = 7.7100V - 2 x 5V = -2.2900V

### For Unipolar Input Ranges

FS = full-scale voltage \(e.g. 10 for 0 - 10V range\) 

Input voltage = \(\(A/D code + 32768\) / 65536\) x FS 

**Example**: 0 - 10V range selected, A/D code = 17762 \(Hex 4560\) 

Input voltage = \(\(17762 + 32768\) / 65536\) x 10V = +7.7103V Note that this is simply the result for the 5V range shifted up by 5V
