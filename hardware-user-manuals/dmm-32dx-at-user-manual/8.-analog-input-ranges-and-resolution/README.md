# 8. ANALOG INPUT RANGES AND RESOLUTION

Diamond-MM-32DX-AT uses a 16-bit A/D converter. This means that the analog input voltage can be measured to the precision of a 16-bit binary number. The maximum value of a 16-bit binary number is 2 ^16 -1 or 65535, so the full range of numerical values that you can get from a Diamond-MM-32DX-AT analog input channel is 0 - 65535.

The smallest change in input voltage that can be detected is 1/\(2^16\), or 1/65536, of the full-scale input range. This smallest change results in an increase or decrease of 1 in the A/D code, and so this change is referred to as 1 LSB, or 1 least significant bit.
