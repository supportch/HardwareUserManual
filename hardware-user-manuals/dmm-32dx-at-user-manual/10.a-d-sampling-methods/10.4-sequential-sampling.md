# 10.4 Sequential Sampling

In sequential sampling, each clock pulse results in a single A/D conversion on the current channel. If the channel range is set to a single channel \(high channel = low channel\), each conversion is performed on the same input channel. If the channel range is set to more than one channel \(high channel &gt; low channel\), then the channel counter increments to the next channel in the range, and the next conversion is performed on that channel. When a conversion is performed on the high channel, the channel counter resets to the low channel for the next conversion. The intervals between all samples are equal. Since each clock pulse results in only one channel being sampled, the effective sampling rate is the programmed sampling rate divided by the number of channels in the channel range.
