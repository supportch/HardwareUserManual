# 7.1 Enabling Enhanced Features \(Enhanced Mode\)

Two steps are required to enable enhanced features: 

1. Set page bits to Page 3 

2. Write code to unlock enhanced features 

Below is the code demonstrating how to enable enhanced features without using the driver software, 

The page bit can be set at Base + 8, \(see page 21\): 

       **outp\(Base + 8, 0x3\);** 

Write 0xA6 to Base + 15 to unlock enhanced features \(see page 28\): 

        **outp\(Base + 15, 0xA6\);**
