# 2. FEATURES

**Analog Inputs**

* 32 input channels, 16-bit resolution 
* May be configured as 32 single-ended, 16 differential, or 16 SE + 8 DI 
* Programmable gain, range, and polarity on inputs
* 250,000 samples per second maximum sampling rate
* 1024-sample FIFO for reduced interrupt overhead 
* Autocalibration of all input ranges under software control 
* Patented hardware-implemented auto-autocalibration

 **Analog Outputs**

* 4 analog output channels with 16-bit standard, 12-bit optional resolution, 5mA max output current 
* Multiple fixed full-scale output ranges, including unipolar and bipolar ranges 
* Programmable full-scale range 
* Patented hardware-implemented auto-autocalibration 
* 1024-sample FIFO for D/A wave form generation 
* 250 KHz maximum update rate Simultaneous update for all 4 channels capability 

**Digital I/O** 

* 24 bi-directional lines using integrated 8255-type circuit 
* Buffered I/O for enhanced current drive 
* Handshaking controls enable external latching of data as well as interrupt operation 
* User-configurable pull-up / pull-down resistors 
* 7 additional I/O lines are fixed direction with programmable functions 

**Counter/Timers and A/D Triggering** 

* 1 32-bit counter/timer for A/D pacer clock and interrupt operation timing 
* 1 16-bit general purpose counter/timer 
* Programmable input sources for each counter/timer 
* External A/D triggering and gating inputs 
* Multiple-board synchronization capability using A/D convert pulse out and external trigger in Interrupts may be generated by counter/timer

**Miscellaneous** 

* Extended temperature â€“40oC to +85oC operation No trimpots or user adjustments required for calibration. 
* Auto autocalibration will automatically adjust the A/D without user input. Calibration time for all modes is approximately 2 seconds. 
* Auto autocalibration of one A/D mode using the onboard dsPIC requires approx 0.5 seconds.
