# 13.GENERATING AN ANALOG OUTPUT

This chapter describes the steps involved in generating an analog output \(also called performing a D/A conversion\) on a selected output channel using direct programming \(not with the driver software\). There are six steps involved in performing a D/A conversion: 

 [      1 . Compute the D/A code for the desired output voltage ](13.1-compute-the-d-a-code-for-the-desired-output-voltage.md)

[       2 . Compute the LSB and MSB values ](13.2-compute-the-lsb-and-msb-values.md)

[       3 . Add the channel number to the MSB ](13.3-add-the-channel-number-to-the-msb.md)

[       4 . Set D/A Simultaneous Update bit ](13.4-set-d-a-simultaneous-update-bit.md)

[       5 . Write the LSB and MSB to the board ](13.5-write-the-lsb-and-msb-to-the-board.md)

[       6.  Monitor the DACBUSY status bit ](13.6-monitor-the-dacbusy-status-bit.md)
