# 13.2 Compute the LSB and MSB values

Use the following formulas to compute the LSB and MSB values: 

LSB = \(D/A Code\) AND 255 ;keep only the low 8 bits 

MSB = int\(\(D/A code\) / 256\) ;strip off low 8 bits, keep 4 high bits 

Example: Output code = 1776 

LSB = 1776 AND 255 = 240 \(F0 Hex\) 

MSB = int\(1776 / 256\) = int\(6.9375\) = 6 

\(In other words, 1776 = 6\*256 + 240\)
