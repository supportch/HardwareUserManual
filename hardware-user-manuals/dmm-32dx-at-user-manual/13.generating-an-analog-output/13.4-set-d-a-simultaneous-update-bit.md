# 13.4 Set D/A Simultaneous Update bit

To update the DAC, set DASIM bit to 0. This will perform an update of the current channel and all previously latched channels, causing a simultaneous update. If no other channels were previously latched, then this will only update the current channel. To latch channel set DASIM bit to 1. 

#### To update: MSB = MSB & 0xDF 

#### To latch: MSB = MSB + 32
