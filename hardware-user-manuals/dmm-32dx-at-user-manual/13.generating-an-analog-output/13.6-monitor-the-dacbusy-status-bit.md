# 13.6 Monitor the DACBUSY status bit

DACBUSY = 1 for 10uS while the data in registers 4 and 5 are serially shifted into the D/A chip. After DACBUSY returns to 0 users can write to register 4 and 5. Registers 4 and 5 should NOT be written to while DACBUSY = 1. If updating multiple channels for simultaneous update repeat steps 1 to 6.

**Example**

D/A is set to +/-5V range. Set channel 1 to 3.000V.

1.Compute D/A code ****

                 ****Using the bipolar mode formula, we compute D/A code = 3V / 5V \* 2048 + 2048 = 3276.8.

                  Round this up to 3277. \(Binary value = 1100 1100 1101\)

2. Compute LSB and MSB.

                   LSB = 3277 & 255 = 205 \(Binary value = 1100 1101\) 

                   MSB = int\(3277/256\) = 12 \(Binary value = 1100\)

3. Add channel number to MSB

                   MSB = 12 + 1 \* 64 = 76

4. Check DASIM. For non-simultaneous update DASIM = 0, for latching DASIM = 1.

                    To update: MSB = MSB & 0xDF 

                    To latch: MSB = MSB + 32

5. Write LSB and MSB to board, enable enhanced features if using latching.

                     outp\(Base + 8, 3\);                              //this is for enabling enhanced features. 

                     Set page bit to 3 outp\(Base + 15, 0xA6\); //enable enhanced features 

                     outp\(Base + 4, LSB\); 

                     outp\(Base + 5, MSB\);

6. Monitor DACBUSY bit, Base + 4 bit 7

                    while \(inp\(Base + 4\) & 0x80\);
