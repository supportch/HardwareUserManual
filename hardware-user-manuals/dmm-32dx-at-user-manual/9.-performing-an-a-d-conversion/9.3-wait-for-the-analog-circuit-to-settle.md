# 9.3 Wait for the analog circuit to settle

After changing either the input channel or the input range, you must allow the circuit to settle on the new value before performing an A/D conversion. The settling time is long compared to software execution times, so a timer is provided on board to indicate when it is safe to proceed with A/D sampling. The WAIT bit at Base + 11 \(see page 24\) indicates when the circuit is settling and when it is safe to sample the input. When WAIT is 1 the board is settling; when WAIT is 0 the board is ready for an A/D conversion.
