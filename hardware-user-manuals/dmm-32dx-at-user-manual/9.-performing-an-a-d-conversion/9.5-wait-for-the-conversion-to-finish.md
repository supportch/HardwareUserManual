# 9.5 Wait for the conversion to finish

The A/D converter takes about 4 microseconds to complete a conversion. If you try to read the A/D converter data immediately after starting a conversion, you will get invalid data. Therefore the A/D converter provides a status signal to indicate whether it is busy or idle. This signal can be read back as the STS bit in the status register at Base + 8 \(see page 21\). When the A/D converter is busy \(performing an A/D conversion\), this bit is 1, and when the A/D converter is idle \(conversion is done and data is available\), this bit is 0.
