# 9.7 Convert the numerical data to a meaningful value

Once you have the A/D value, you need to convert it to a meaningful value. The formulas on page 36 show you how to convert the A/D data back to the original input voltage. You may want to convert it into engineering units afterwards or instead. The two conversions can be done sequentially, or the formulas can be combined into a single formula.
