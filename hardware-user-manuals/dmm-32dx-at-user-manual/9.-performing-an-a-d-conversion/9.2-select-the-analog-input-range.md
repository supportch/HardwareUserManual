# 9.2 Select the analog input range

Select the code from page 35 corresponding to the desired input range and write it to the analog I/O control register at Base + 11. You only need to write to this register if you want to select a different input range from the one used for the previous conversion. If all channels will be using the same input range, you can configure this register just once at the beginning of your procedure. You can read the current value of this register by reading from Base + 11
