# 9.1 Select the input channel or input channel range

Diamond-MM-32DX-AT contains a channel counter circuit that controls which channel will be sampled on each A/D conversion command. The circuit uses two channel numbers called the low channel and high channel. These are stored in registers at Base + 2 and Base + 3 \(see page 17\). The circuit starts at the low channel and automatically increments after each A/D conversion until the high channel is reached. When an A/D conversion is performed on the high channel, the circuit resets to the low channel and starts over again. This behavior enables you simplify your software by setting the channel range just once. 

To read continuously from a single channel, write the same channel number to both the low channel and high channel registers. 

To read from a series of consecutively numbered channels, write the starting channel to Base + 2 and the ending channel to Base + 3. 

To read from a group of non-consecutive channels, you must treat each as a single channel described above.
