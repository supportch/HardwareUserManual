 **Page 4, Base + 12        Read/Write         dsPIC Data Register**

| PICR/W | Read/write control: 0 = write, 1 = read |
| PICA4-0 | dsPIC internal address |

Writing a byte with R/W = ‘0’ will cause the dsPIC to write the data contained in the dsPIC Data Register above to the dsPIC internal address indicated by PICA4-0. Writing a byte with R/W = ‘1’ will cause the dsPIC to read the data at dsPIC internal address, PICA4-0 and place the received data in the dsPIC Data Register.

| I2CBSY | I2C port status bit: |
|      0 | Last I2C operation completed |
|      1 | Last I2C operation in progress |

**Page 4, Base + 14         Write           Auto-Autocalibration Command Register**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/34%20%283%29.png)

Only one bit can be set to ‘1’ at once. Bits are processed MSB to LSB. The first ‘1’ determines which command is carried out.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| ACHOLD | 1 = Auto-autocal process is disabled. Autocalibration must be triggered by software |
| ACREL | 1 = Auto-autocal process is enabled. Auto-autocalibration will occur whenever the board requires it. |
| PICRST | 1 = Reset dsPIC device. This command is normally not needed. |
| ACABT | 1 = Abort any currently running auto-autocal operation immediately |
| ACTRIG | 1 = Initiate an auto-autocal process immediately |

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| ACHOLD | 1 = dsPIC in holdoff mode \(auto-autocal disabled\) |
| PICPRST | 1 = dsPIC device present on board |
| ACERR | 1 = dsPIC detected errors during last Auto-autocal process |
| ACACT | 1 = Auto-autocal process currently in progress |
| PICBSY | 1 = dsPIC busy, either with auto-autocal or some other activity |

Details concerning auto-autocalibration can be found at in chapter 15 on page 48.

**Page 4, Base + 15         Write           dsPIC Programming Register**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/36%20%282%29.png)

This register is used to control the on-board dsPIC microcontroller. The dsPIC controls the auto-autocalibration process, and it also provides the communication link between the board and its serial port. The bits in this register are control bits, not register bits. Only one bit can be set to ‘1’ at once. Bits are processed MSB to LSB. The first ‘1’ determines which command is carried out

| PSTART | Drive EN\_PROG\# signal low. |
| PSTOP | Drive EN\_PROG\# high. |
| PGDOUT | FPGA makes PIC\_PGD line an output, but leave at current level \(i.e. perform input to find current level, set line as an output at same level.\) |
| PGDIN | FPGA makes PIC\_PGD line an input. |
| PGDW1 | If PIC\_PGD line is in output mode, set high |
| PGDW0 | If PIC\_PGD line is in output mode, set low |
| PGCW1 | Set PIC\_PGC line high |
| PGCW0 | Set PIC\_PGC line low |

PGDR       Reads back current level of PIC\_PGD line \(low = 0, high = 1\)
