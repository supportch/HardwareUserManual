# 12.1 Description



Diamond-MM-32DX-AT uses a four-channel 16-bit standard \(12-bit optional\) D/A converter \(DAC\) to provide four analog outputs. A 16-bit DAC can generate output voltages with the precision of a 16-bit binary number. The maximum value of a 16-bit binary number is 2^16-1, or 65535, so the full range of numerical values that you can write to the analog outputs on Diamond-MM-32DX-AT is 0 – 65535 \(or 0 – 4095\).

**Note**: In this manual, the terms analog output, D/A, and DAC are all used interchangeably to mean the same thing
