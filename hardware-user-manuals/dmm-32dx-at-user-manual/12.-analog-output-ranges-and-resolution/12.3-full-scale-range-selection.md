# 12.3 Full-Scale Range Selection

The D/A converter chip on Diamond-MM-32DX-AT requires two references, one for the low end and one for the high end of the range. The high end can be set to 5V, 10V, or Programmable, and the low end can be either 0V \(for unipolar output ranges\) or minus the high-end voltage. See page 12 for information on configuring the D/A range. All channels are set to the same output range. 

On power up, the D/A automatically resets to the range and polarity set by the hardware jumpers and with the output voltage set to 0V.
