# 14.5 Latch D/A value

Procedure for latching a D/A value is nearly identical to the formula in chapter 13 “Generating An Analog Output”, page 44. The D/A value code must be computed for the desired voltage, from that obtain the LSB and MSB, add the channel number and set DAGEN bit. Write final LSB and MSB to registers 4 and 5. The only difference from the formula in the previous chapter is instead of setting the DASIM bit to 1, set DAGEN bit to 1. By setting the DAGEN bit to 1 the D/A value written will be latched to internal memory instead of the DAC chip.
