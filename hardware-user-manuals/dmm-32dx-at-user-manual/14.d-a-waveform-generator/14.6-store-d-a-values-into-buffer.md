# 14.6 Store D/A values into buffer

Once the D/A code is latched, it must be stored in the waveform buffer. Set Page to 5 and write the buffer address \(0 to 1023\) for the latched D/A value into Base + 12 and 13. When Base + 13 is written to, the latched D/A value at Base + 4 and 5 will be loaded and stored into the waveform memory. Both the D/A output code and D/A output channel would be stored.
