# Digital I/O Features

* Dual 82C55A Parallel Peripheral Interfaces \(PPI\) logic implemented in FPGA cores. 
* Each 82C55A has three 8-bit I/O ports for a total of 48 DIO lines, which connect to a 50-pin header for external connections. 
* Port direction and operation is selected through software programmable control registers.
* All lines are buffered with transceivers.
