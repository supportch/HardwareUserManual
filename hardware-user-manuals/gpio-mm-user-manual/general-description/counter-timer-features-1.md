# Counter/Timer Features

* Dual CTS9513 counter/timers logic implemented in FPGA cores.
* A 40MHz clock input, providing higher precision timer functions.         
* Timing functions are software programmable, using control registers. 
* Ten 16-bit programmable up/down counters with sophisticated timing logic:  
  * Up or down counting. 
  * Binary or BCD counting. 
  * Single or repetitive counting.
  * Edge or level gating
  * Output pulse or toggle capability. 
  * Alarm comparator circuitry. 
  * Software or hardware retriggering.
* 8-bit TTL input and 8-bit TTL output ports, which can operate in bit- or byte mode. 
* An interrupt line for generating interrupts to the CPU. 
* An external 50-pin header for connecting to the counter/timer features.
