## 3.10 PCIe Link routing

Gemini supports multiple PCIe routings based on module configurations used. 

For module which supports 8 x1 lanes GEM-BB01can be used in which the PCIe lanes are routed from module to support Serial port, mPCIe socket, Ethernet port, PCIe to PCI bridge and PCIe/104 expansion.

For modules which have 5 or lesser PCIe lanes GEM-BB02,GEM-BB03 and GEM-BB04 should be used based on PCIe lanes available from module to support all IO interfaces along with PCIe/104 expansion.

All Gemini variants have PCIe x16 lane connected to PCIe/104 banks 2 & 3.

{% hint style="info" %}
The x16 PCIe lane support is module dependant
{% endhint %}

### 3.10.1 GEM-BB01 : 8- Lane PCIe x1 available from Module

On COM modules supporting eight PCIe x1 lanes, the lanes are routed from the COM module and mapped to the on-board I/O interfaces and expansion sockets as specified in the following table and the diagram below.

| PCIe Lane from COM Module | Interface | Assigned To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
