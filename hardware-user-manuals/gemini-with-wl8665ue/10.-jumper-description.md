## 10.1 JP1 Serial Termination Jumper

Gemini provides option termination resistors for RS422 and RS485 protocols. 

When loaded 121-Ohm resistor is connected across differential pairs.

{% hint style="info" %}
JP1 jumpers are not loaded by default. 
{% endhint %}

The label number corresponds to silk screen labels on PCB for pin locations.

| Label | Jumper Pins | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1-2 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 1 TX |
| 2 | 3-4 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 2 TX |
| 3 | 5-6 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 1 RX |
| 4 | 7-8 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 2 RX |
| 5 | 9-10 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 3 TX |
| 6 | 11-12 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 4 TX |
| 7 | 13-14 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 3 RX |
| 8 | 15-16 | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 4 RX |

## 10.2 JP2 Peripheral voltage selector

On Gemini JP2 provides option to select PCI I/O voltage level, LCD supply voltage and LCD backlight supply voltage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pinout is designed to prevent possiblity of shorting two supply voltages if loaded in correclty.
{% endhint %}

The label number corresponds to silk screen labels on PCB for pin locations.

| Label | Signal | Pin | Pin | Signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 5V | 1 | 2 | NC |
| 2 | V-PCI | 3 | 4 | 3.3V |
| 3 | V-LVDS | 5 | 6 | 3.3V |
| 4 | 5V | 7 | 8 | NC |
| 5 | NC | 9 | 10 | 12V |
| 6 | 5V | 11 | 12 | V-Backlight |

Table below shows jumper settings for JP2. Default setting is highlighted in **Bold**.

| Label Position | Voltage Selection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1-2 Left** | V-PCI = 5V |
| 2\(across\) | V-PCI = 3.3V |
| **3\(across\)** | V-LVDS = 3.3V |
| 3-4 Left | V-LVDS = 5V |
| 5-6 Right | V-Backlight = 12V |
| 6**\(across\)** | V-Backlight = 5V |

## 10.3 JP3 Serial Port Protocol Selector and USB Mux selection

Gemini has jumper JP3 to select the Serial protocols for serial port pairs and USB 2.0 signals for  USB to I2C bridge or minicard socket.

The serial port labels and associated functions are specified in the table below.

| Label | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | USB 2.0 Assignment |
| 2 | Serial Port 1,2 Mode 2 |
| 3 | Serial Port 3,4 Mode 2 |
| 4 | Serial Port 1,2 Mode 0 |
| 5 | Serial Port 3,4 Mode 0 |

{% hint style="info" %}
Jumper labels 2 and 4 must be used for serial protocol selection of Ports 1 and 2.

Jumper labels 3 and 5 must be used for serial protocol selection of Ports 3 and 4.
{% endhint %}

| Label 2/3 Jumper IN/OUT \(Mode 2\) | Label 4/5 Jumper IN/OUT \(Mode 0\) | Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OUT | OUT | RS232 |
| IN | OUT | Loopback |
| OUT | IN | RS422 |
| IN | IN | RS485 |

USB 2.0 jumper option is as given below\(default option in **Bold\)**:

| Label | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| Label 1 Jumper IN/OUT | USB 2.0 Assignment |
| **IN** | GPIO Expander |
| OUT | PCIe MiniCard |
