# 2. INTRODUCTION & PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS

### 2.1 Introduction

### 2.1.1 Gemini Carrier Board Overview

Gemini carrier board is the newest addition to Diamond Systems wide range of innovative product-line that integrates the latest generation of the embedded COM Express® Compact cExpress-WLType 6 Module, featuring Intel® 8th Generation Quad/Dual-Core™ i3–i7 and Celeron® processors, and PCI/104-Express Expansion Gen 5 and Gen 4 technologies.

Designed in a compact-sized form-factor H 4.00” x W 4.00” \(101.6 mm x 101.6 mm\), Gemini carrier board offers a scalable embedded system infrastructure that significantly enhances performance, power efficiency, and optimized I/O capabilities.

The carrier board's mechanical dimensions slightly exceed the dimensions of the COM Express Compact and PC/104 modules to enable synchronicity of mounting hole patterns of both form factors with the carrier board. This also increases the Printed Circuit Board \(PCB\) real estate to provide additional space for I/O connectors.

The PCI/104-Express expansion sockets are located on the top side of the board. The COM Express module is mounted on the bottom side of the board.

The carrier board is a multi-layer Printed Circuit Board that is designed on a thicker scale measuring .090” \(2.3 mm\). The thickness sustains increased ruggedness for latching I/O connectors, mechanical load of other assembly components, and operating temperatures ranging from -40° to +85° C. This enables the carrier board to operate reliably in mobile and harsh environmental applications.

The following table summarizes the on-board key features, components, and specifications of the Gemini carrier board.
